TryHackMe WriteUps
==================

These are write-ups/walkthroughs I have written for rooms on TryHackMe. They are both references/notes to myself and educational material to those looking to learn Ethical Hacking.

Questions can be mailed to [me@jarrodrizor.com](mailto:me@jarrodrizor.com) or I can reply via Twitter [@JarrodRizor](https://twitter.com/JarrodRizor)
